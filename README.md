## Multi-dimensional Baysian Network Classifier
### Lynda C. Van der Gaag. &   Peter R. de Waal  
  
  Bayesian Network Classifiers for solving classification problems where an instance described by a number of features has to be classified  in one of several classes  
A Multi- dimensional BN Classifier include one or more class variables and one or more features variables  
It models the relationship between the variables by acyclic directed graph over the class and over the features and connect tow set by a bi-partite directed graph
